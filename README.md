# mcmc-text-decoding
Developed an MCMC algorithm to decode encrypted text using substitution ciphers. Implemented functions for counting character frequencies and character pairs, using probability concepts to improve decoding accuracy. Addressed the inefficiency of evaluating all possible codebooks by employing MCMC to efficiently explore and converge to a solution.
